\title{Align Multiple Vectors by Matching Values}
\usage{
align_vectors(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Vectors to be aligned. Any number of vectors can be provided, and they do not need to be of the same length.
The names of the vectors in the argument list will be used as column names in the output data frame.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row represents a unique element from the union of all input vectors. Columns are named
        after the input vectors. Each column aligns its values to this unique element list, and positions with no match
        are filled with \code{NA}. Rows with all \code{NA} values are removed.
}
\description{
\code{align_vectors} takes multiple vectors as input and aligns them by unique values,
creating a data frame with matched rows across all vectors and filling unmatched positions with \code{NA}.
This function is useful for comparing multiple sets of elements and aligning them based on common values.
}
\examples{
# Example vectors
x <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")
y <- c("a", NA, NA, "d", "e")
z <- c("f", "b", "d", NA, "a")

# Align vectors x, y, and z
align_vectors(x, y, z)
# Expected Output:
#   x    y    z
# 1 a    a    a
# 2 b   NA    b
# 3 c   NA   NA
# 4 d    d    d
# 5 NA   e   NA
# 6 NA   NA   f
