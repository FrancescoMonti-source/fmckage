\title{Process PMSI Raw Data into a Flat Data Frame}
\usage{
process_pmsi_core(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list where each element represents a patient record (as a list of variables).
The elements may be nested, and may contain atomic vectors or short lists.}
}
\value{
A tibble where each row corresponds to a patient and each column represents
a flattened field. All values are character vectors; fields containing multiple
values are collapsed into a \verb{;}-separated string.
}
\description{
This function takes a list of nested patient data objects (e.g., parsed from PMSI data),
flattens each patient record into a single-row data frame, and combines all patients
into a single tibble. It ensures consistent column types and prevents data loss due
to inconsistent structures by coercing all fields to character.
